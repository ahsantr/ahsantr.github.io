I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab](https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by [Xie Guangming](https://ocean.pku.edu.cn/info/1184/2268.htm). Previously, I was lecturer at [Air University](https://au.edu.pk/). I completed my M.S. at [GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Techology]() in mechanical engineering in July 2021. At GIK, I was advised by [Sarvat Ahmad](https://cie.kfupm.edu.sa/people/faculty/dr-sarvat-m-ahmad/) and was a member of [Vibrational Dynamics and Control Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/controllabgiki/home). I received my B.S. from [University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar](https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/) with highest honors in mechanical engineering in 2019. I also worked at [King Fahd Univeristy of Petroleum and Minerals](https://www.kfupm.edu.sa/) and [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/).

Research interests
======
Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in some of the modern areas of soft robotics, applied controls, and machine learning with special emphasis on marine robots.

More specifically, Iâ€™m interested in the following topics:
1. Multi-sensor exteroceptive perception for soft robotic manipulation in murky underwater environment
2. Bio-inspired flexible sensors and actuators for soft underwater robots
3. Development of high fidelity dynamics models of soft robots to bridge simulation-to-reality gap for enhanced control performance in real experiments
