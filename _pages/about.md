I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab](https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by [Xie Guangming](https://ocean.pku.edu.cn/info/1184/2268.htm). Previously, I was lecturer at [Air University](https://au.edu.pk/). I completed my M.S. at [GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Techology]() in mechanical engineering in July 2021. At GIK, I was advised by [Sarvat Ahmad](https://cie.kfupm.edu.sa/people/faculty/dr-sarvat-m-ahmad/) and was a member of [Vibrational Dynamics and Control Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/controllabgiki/home). I received my B.S. from [University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar](https://www.uetpeshawar.edu.pk/) with highest honors in mechanical engineering in 2019. I also worked at [King Fahd Univeristy of Petroleum and Minerals](https://www.kfupm.edu.sa/) and [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/).

Research interests
======
Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in some of the modern areas of soft robotics, applied controls, and machine learning with special emphasis on marine robots.

More specifically, Iâ€™m interested in the following topics:
1. Multi-sensor exteroceptive perception for soft robotic manipulation in murky underwater environment
2. Bio-inspired flexible sensors and actuators for soft underwater robots
3. Development of high fidelity dynamics models of soft robots to bridge simulation-to-reality gap for enhanced control performance in real experiments

Get in touch
======
Please feel free to reach out, if you would like to talk about my work or discuss something of mutual interest.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
