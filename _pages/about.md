I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Intelligent Biomimetic Design Lab](https://en.ibdl.pku.edu.cn/) at Peking University, supervised by Xie Guangming. Previously, I was lecturer at Air University. I completed my M.S. at GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Techology in mechanical engineering in July 2021. At GIK, I was advised by Sarvat Ahmad and was a member of [Vibrational Dynamics and Control Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/controllabgiki/home). I received my B.S. from University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar with highest honors in mechanical engineering in 2019. I also worked at King Fahd Univeristy of Petroleum and Minerals and National University of Sciences and Technology.

**Research interests
**
Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in some of the modern areas of soft robotics, applied controls, and machine learning with special emphasis on marine robots.

More specifically, Iâ€™m interested in the following topics:
1. Multi-sensor exteroceptive perception for soft robotic manipulation in murky underwater environment
2. Bio-inspired flexible sensors and actuators for soft underwater robots
3. Development of high fidelity dynamics models of soft robots to bridge simulation-to-reality gap for enhanced control performance in real experiments

Please feel free to reach out, if you would like to talk about my work or discuss something of mutual interest.
