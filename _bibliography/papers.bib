  title={High Fidelity Modelling and GA Optimized Control of Yaw Dynamics of a Custom Built Remotely Operated Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={In this paper, a custom built, underactuated, inspection class micro Remotely Operated Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (ROV) is employed as a testbed to investigate control and modelling problems related to underwater vehicles in shallow waters and pools. Dynamic model for yaw is obtained via mathematical modelling and system identification techniques. To instil confidence in the identified model, residuals and cross-validation tests are carried out to obtain high fidelity vehicle model for subsequent stabilizing closed-loop control design. Following the modelling exercise, design, real-time implementation, and analysis of a GA optimized PI controller for yaw is carried out. The performance of the GA optimized controller is benchmarked against the experimental results of a multi-parameter root-locus tuned PI controller and simulated responses of a standard linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In addition, the efficacy of the GA-PI controller is gauged employing recently developed marine predator algorithm (MPA). The need for a controller with optimized performance motivated the utilization of GA and MPA optimization techniques. The results from real-time pool experiments indicate substantially enhanced performance of GA optimized controller, outperforming other controllers by as much as 22% in performance indicators such as settling time and maximum overshoot. Furthermore, the GA optimized controller demonstrated far better robustness and disturbance rejection capabilities.},

  title={Mathematical Modelling and Fluidic Thrust Vectoring Control of a Delta Wing UAV},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={Pitch control of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using fluidic thrust vectoring (FTV) is a relatively novel technique requiring no moving control surfaces, such as elevators. In this paper, the authorsâ€™ previous work on the characterization of a static co-flow FTV rig is further validated using the free to pitch dynamic test bench. The deflection of a primary jet after injection of a high-velocity secondary jet was captured using the tuft flow visualization technique, along with the experimental recording of subsequent normal force impinged on the Coanda surface resulting in the pitching moment. The effect of primary and secondary flow velocities on exhaust jet deflection, as well as on the pitch angle of the aircraft, is examined. Aerodynamic gain as well as the inertia of a delta wing UAV test bench are computed through experiments and fed into the equation of motion (e.o.m). The e.o.m developed aided in the design of a model-based PID controller for pitch motion control using the multi-parameter root locus technique. The root locus tuned controller serves as a benchmark controller for performance evaluation of the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned controllers. Furthermore, the frequency domain metric of gain and phase margins were also employed to reach a robust control design. Experiments conducted in a simulation environment reveal that PSO-PID results in a better response of the UAV in comparison to the baseline pitch controller.},

  title={Cross-Coupled Dynamics and MPA-Optimized Robust MIMO Control for a Compact Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={A compact, 3-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), low-cost, remotely operated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), or MicroROV, is custom-designed, developed, instrumented, and interfaced with a PC for real-time data acquisition and control. The nonlinear equations of motion (EoM) are developed for the under-actuated, open-frame, cross-coupled MicroROV utilizing the Newton-Euler approach. The cross-coupling between heave and yaw motion, an important dynamic of a class of compact ROVs that is barely reported, is investigated here. This work is thus motivated towards developing an understanding of the physics of the highly coupled compact ROV and towards developing model-based stabilizing controllers. The linearized EoM aids in developing high-fidelity experimental data-driven transfer function models. The coupled heave-yaw transfer function model is improved to an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model structure. The acquired models facilitate the use of the multi-parameter root-locus (MPRL) technique to design baseline controllers for a cross-coupled multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) MicroROV. The controller gains are further optimized by employing an innovative Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA). The robustness of the designed controllers is gauged using gain and phase margins. In addition, the real-time controllers were deployed on an onboard embedded system utilizing Simulink's automatic C++ code generation capabilities. Finally, pool tests of the MicroROV demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

  title={Design and Testing of a Compact Inexpensive Prototype Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle for Shallow Water Operation},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={This article introduces the development of an unmanned remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that measures 35 cm x 26 cm x 23 cm and weighs 1.59 kg. The primary objective is to remotely communicate in real time using serial protocol to record the vehicle's orientation data. The three DC motors powering the ROV are controlled by a multi-parameter root-locus proportional integral (MRPL-PI) controller. Utilizing the processing capabilities of the Atmega328 microcontroller, heading, depth control, and water condition monitoring are all accomplished simultaneously. The Arduino development environment is used to establish the ROV's remote control. The problem with human divers who can only descend to a depth of 30 meters is resolved by the proposed ROV's ability to dive up to 100 meters underwater. Furthermore, the suggested vehicle can be beneficial in marine applications such as measurement, maintenance, operations, and surveillance.},
